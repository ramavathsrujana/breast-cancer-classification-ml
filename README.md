# Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases affecting women worldwide. Early and accurate classification of breast tumors as **Benign** or **Malignant** plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes.

This project uses **Machine Learning techniques**, specifically **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Random Forest**, to classify breast cancer tumors based on clinical features. The models are trained and evaluated using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**, and their performance is compared using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
